Simruby base application
========================

Hi ! This is the base simruby application. You *can* use it as a starting
point to build the application that will make all the simruby rails specs pass.

It provides a few of the initial features required by the specs, to provide
you with some code examples and help you move forward a little bit faster.

Requirement
-----------

* A ruby interpreter, version 2.x
* Ideally PostgreSQL or libsqlite3 (all is included in the devbox)

Setup
-----

The setup steps of this rails application is nothing more than the bare minimal
and traditional rails setup steps.

* cd into the folder
* `bundle install`
* Edit config/database.yml
* `rake db:setup`
* rails server

Enjoy !
